<h2>Detection Details(s)</h2>
Description: A process has written a suspicious file to disk. Adversaries may write a malicious file to a commonly trusted directory, use a benign name, or a mismatched file extension. This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation. 

<br>Check the activity and surrounding events are expected in your environment. Detection is based on a high degree of entropy, packing, anti-malware evasion, or other similarity to known malware. A file written to the file system meets the on-sensor machine learning high confidence threshold for malicious files.

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
Crowdstrike Falcon labeled the alert as Suspicious File Written.  The alert was detected on 07-08-2023 11:02:58.  

Based on OSINT research, a malicious zip file was downloaded from a website.  I did a host search to find the URL where the zip file was downloaded and was unable to find it.  Based on our SOP, I would escalate this to our SOC manager for the root cause analysis.  

The user unzipped the file and executed mimikatz.exe.  Crowdstrike policy was set on detect, so the file was not quarantined.  Mimikatz.exe steals passwords on Windows machines, so this is a critical situation.  

The steps I did take to mitigate the malicious activity are:
- I disconnected the endpoint from the network.  
- I have permission to connect to the host to locate the zip file and remove it.  I followed our playbook to remove the zip file (Temp1_mimikatz-master.zip).
- I ran an AV scan on the endpoint to make sure I removed all of the malicious activity from the endpoint.

<br />

<h2>Declaration</h2>
The detection is a true positive because mimikatz.exe was successfully executed.

<h2>Recommendation(s)</h2>
I recommended help desk reset the userâ€™s password.
